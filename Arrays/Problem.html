<h2>Problem:</h2>

// Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.
//Return the sorted array.
<br><br><br><br>
//Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.
<br><br><br><br>

//Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order. 
<br><br><br><br>
// Example 3: 
Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
<br><br><br><br>

// Constraints: 
//1 <= nums.length <= 100
//-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
<br><br><br><br>

<h2>Thinking Process:</h2>
<br>
//Goals//<br><br>
//1. Sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values    <br><br>
//2. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order<br><br>
//3. Return the sorted array<br><br>

<h2>Thinking Process</h2>
// Whats the correct data structure to use? <br><br>
// Frequency Map, Frequency Table, Frequenct dictionary<br><br>
//A frequency map, also known as a frequency table or frequency dictionary, is a data structure that stores the frequency or count of occurrences of elements in a collection. In the context of the given problem, the frequency map will store the frequency of each number in the input array.
In JavaScript, a frequency map can be implemented using an object or a Map. <br><br>
